# ExcelArt
Convert any image to Pixel Art in an Excel sheet.

Also usable as reference to build minecraft pixel art.

## Instructions
1. Install the dependencies  ```pip install -r requirements```
2. Run the program ```main.py```
3. Enter the **image path** (include the image extension .png, .jpg, etc.) 
4. Enter the **excel size**, must be lower than 1000 (The mayor the size the longer it'll take, be careful)
5. It'll create an excel file called "draw.xlsx" with your pixel art in there :)

## Examples
